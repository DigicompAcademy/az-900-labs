# 15 - Implement resource tagging (5 min)

In this walkthrough, we will create a policy assignment that requires tagging, created a storage account and test the tagging, view resources with a specified tag, and remove the tagging policy.

# Task 1: Create a Policy assignment 

In this task, we will configure the **Require a tag on resources** policy and assign it to our subscription. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Policy**.

3. Scroll down to the **Authoring** section, click **Assignments**, and then click **Assign Policy** from the top of the  page.

4. Notice the **Scope** for our policy will be subscription wide. 

5. Under **Basics** Select the **Policy definition** ellipsis button (right side of textbox). In the **Search** box, enter the value **tag**. A list of related Policies with the word **tag** will appear. Scroll down till you find the **Require a tag and its value on resources** definition, click on it and click **Select**.

   >**Attention** Do not select ```Require a tag and its value on resource groups ```
   
6.  On the **Parameters** tab, type in **Company : Contoso ** for the tag key/value pair name. Click **Review + create**, and then **Create**.

  

7. The **Require a tag amd its value on resources** policy assignment is now in place. When a resource is created, it must include a tag with the Company : Contoso key.
   >**Note - you need to wait up to 30 minutes for the Policy to be applied.**

# Task 2: Create a storage account to test the required tagging

In this task, we will create storage accounts to test the required tagging. 

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **All services** blade, search for and select **Storage accounts**, and then click **+Create**.

2. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, fill in the following information (replace **xxxx** in the name of the storage account with letters and digits such that the name is globally unique). Leave the defaults for everything else.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | **Use default provided** |
    | Resource group | Click on **Create new** <br /> Name: **15-tags** |
    | Storage account name | **storageaccountxxxx** |
    | Location | **(US) East US** |

3. Click **Review + create**. 

    **Note:** We are testing to see what happens when the tag is not supplied. Please note, it can take up to 30 minutes for Policies to take effect.

4. You will receive a Validation failed message. Click the **Click here to view details** message. On the **Errors** blade, on the **Summary** tab note the error message stating that resource was disallowed by Policy.

    **Note:** If you view the Raw Error tab you will see the specific tag name that is required.

5. Close the **Error** pane and click **Previous** (bottom of the screen). Provide the tagging information. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Tag name | **Company:Contoso** (may not be in the drop-down list) |

6. Click **Review + create** and verify that the validation was successful. Click **Create** to deploy the storage account. 

# Task 3: View all resources with a specific tag

1. In the Azure Portal, from the **All services** blade, search for and select **Tags**.

2. Note all tags and their values. Click the **Company : Contoso** key/value pair. This will display a blade showing the newly created storage account, as long as you included the tag during its deployment.

3. In the Portal, display the **All resources** blade.

4. Click **Add filter** and add the **Company** tag key as the filter category. With the filter applied, only your storage account will be listed.

# Task 4: Delete the policy assignment

In this task, we will remove the **Require a tag on resources** policy so it does not affect our future work. 

1. In the portal, from the **All services** blade, search for and select **Policy**.

2. Click the **Require a tag on resources** policy entry.

3. Click **Delete Assignment** in the top menu.

4. Confirm you wish to delete the policy assignment in the **Delete assignment** dialogue by clicking **Yes**

5. If you have time, create another resource without a tag to ensure the policy is no longer in effect.

Congratulations! In this walkthrough, we created a policy assignment that required tagging, created a resource (storage account) and tested the Policy for tagging, viewed resources with a specified tag, and removed the tagging policy.


**Note**: To avoid additional costs, you can optionally remove this resource group. Search for resource groups, click your resource group, and then click **Delete resource group**. Verify the name of the resource group and then click **Delete**. Monitor the **Notifications** to see how the delete is proceeding.
